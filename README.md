# Eye Shader
This project features a Unity shader that simulates the experience of blinking from a first-person perspective. With each blink, the image gradually becomes sharper, continuing until full clarity is reached. The shader is applied to the main camera to create an immersive effect of regaining focus through a sequence of blinks.
